# customer-segmentation
In this notebook, I am leveraging an online store transactions data to run customers segmentation based on their RFM behaviors. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value. 
- Recency : measure how recent each customer's last purchase.
- Frequency : measures how many purchases the customer has done.
- Monetary Value : measures how much has the customer spend.
